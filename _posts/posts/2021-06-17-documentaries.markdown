It was a couple of months ago (somewhere around March) when I stumbled upon the world of mountaineering. For the uninitiated, K2 is the second tallest mountain at 8611m, only behind Everest (8849m). Yet what kinda intrigued me intially was that K2 was viewed as the more difficult mountain to climb. The fatality rate of K2 is around 25-30%. 1 in 4 people who attempt K2 do not come back alive. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, as of February 2021, only 377 poeple have completed the ascent. This is stunningly high compared to Everest; death rate ~1%. For the most part, this can be attributed to the higher degree of technicality, although it can be argued that this is reduced because there have been more summit attempts.

Hearing their heavy breathing and watching climbers creep up almost vertical surfaces is truly terrifying. You would think that the absurd likelihood of death would put be sufficient to put people off. Here are more reasons why attempting to climb K2, or any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-thousander" target="_blank">eight-thousanders</a> borderlines insanity:

1. Remoteness

    The journey to the summit of K2 doesn't start at base camp, but rather from the village of Askole. The trek to base camp itself is already physically and mentally draining: it takes around 8-9 **walking** days (in all ~ 21 days) with a distance of 90km (<a href="https://trangoadventure.com/how-to-trek-to-k2-base-camp/" target="_blank">reference</a>). That is also with all your equipment.

2. Money

    Attempting to climb K2 requires extensive planning and a considerable amount of money. 

    From <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-it-cost-to-climb-the-K2-Mountain" target="_blank">Jake Meyer from Quora</a>, 
    > For a ‘high-end’ trip to K2, you’re looking at around $60,000–$75,000 for a highly supported ‘western’ climbing company. This will include plenty of Sherpas, HAPs, (relatively) unlimited Oxygen, high quality base camp (unlimited internet etc), international food etc.
    >
    > Mid-range expeditions (but still non-Pakistan operators) are around $35,000-$45,000. Less support on the mountain (although could still have 1–2–1 Sherpa support), and limited O2. There is much more requirement for climbers to be more competent and experienced if they want to stand a good chance of summiting (or more importantly surviving!)

3. Weather and Altitude

    Climbing in the winter is a death sentence. You really need to be lucky. Embarking into high altitude, especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_zone" target="_blank">Death Zone</a>, puts the human body through a whole host of physiological challenges, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_pulmonary_edema" target="_blank">HAPE</a>, all of which can impair the brain's ability to think logically. Extensive acclimatization and climbing experience (>10 years) are necessary.

<br>

Summiting a mountain is often only half of the battle; descending it is way more dangerous. Here is an incredible attempt to ski down K2:

</p>

<br>

Ironically, the difficulty of climbing mountains is probably what draws many of the mountaineers to attempt to summit K2. If it was too easy, I don't think K2 will appeal to them. It also helps that the views are amazing.

### WW2 History

It is kinda crazy to think how easy it is for countries to go to war. Assasinate someone, blame and invade a country, and because of existing alliances, multiple countries can go to war just like that. It is also interesting to see that more often than not, territories and resources seem to be secondary relative to spreading ideologies. Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan each thought that their people and race were superior to others. Hitler's decision to start the fight on the Eastern front (Operation Barbarossa) while facing the Allies on the Western front, and how the event unfolded at Stalingrad really showed that blitzing through battle may not always be the most ideal strategy, especially when Russia is hella big and cold. 

Some stuff that I thought were interesting from WW2:

1. Horses

    </p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_in_World_War_II" target="_blank">Horses</a> were still being used as cavalry during WW2 as the transition to motorised vehicles were still underway. You would think that they would become obsolete after WW1. I think the Germans took advantage of this against the Poles.

2. Balloons in war

    </p>


    The Japanese utilised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu-Go_balloon_bomb" target="_blank">bombs</a> strapped on silk balloons to attack the USA. Because the Pacific Ocean is so vast, a full scale land invasion is very difficult via ship. Balloons were launched across the Pacific towards the west coast of the US. Because of media blackout, the Japanese were not able to ascertain as to whether the balloons were effective or not. Most of them were ineffective.

    On the Western front, balloons were used for reconnaissance in WW1, and were used to hinder enemy aircrafts as they cannot fly through the balloons (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrage_balloon" target="_blank">barrage balloons</a>).

3. Switzerland's involvement in WW2

    <p align="center">

        Screenshotted from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FILxoQyKzDg" target="_blank">America's 'War' Against Switzerland</a>
    </p>

    As a neutral country in the war, Switzerland was not spared from the German threat from most of its borders. Any aircraft, from the Allies or Axis powers, were to be shot down if it entered Swiss airspace. Being sandwiched between Allied and Axis territories, they were occassionally bombed by both sides. They were mostly accidents allegedly, but who knows?

<br>

The tragedies and destruction of war must not be forgotten. After all, it only happened less than a century ago, and many conflicts and wars are still ongoing in many parts of the world. Ideologies and perceptions often permeate for many decades past the formal end of conflict. War crimes made by the Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany really showed that conquering land and resources were not the only objective of engaging in war. Even the Allies participated in questionable practices against innocent civilians.

### Louis Theroux

Stumbled upon Louis when watching University Challenge videos early this year. He was leader of the Magdalen College, Oxford team for one of the Christmas episodes. Appeared like an interesting dude on the show, so I read up more about him and discovered that he was famous in creating documentaries. What makes his documentaries interesting are the way he approaches the documentaries, and the controversial and taboo topics that he covers. Louis has a innate talent of communicating with the personalities on the documentaries without turning them off. In the early documentaries, he is able to probe them while giving them the vibes that he is just like a curious young man trying to find himself in the world (maybe he was at that time I don't know). He approaches each episode with his own prejudice, and yet is open to new ideas. Now that he is more well-known, I'm not sure how much these subjects will be willing to divulge to Louis. This can affect the quality of future documentaries Louis does, but Louis is already a legend. Hopefully a documentary series like Weird Weekends can come around soon.

Some of my favourites are:
- Weird Weekends (basically all of them)
- Louis and the Nazis
- The Most Hated Family in America (that covers the Phelps family)
