I find it highly problematic with the amount of misinformation that is rampant in today's media. Aren't we taught back when we were 13-14 years old that before formulating a **concrete** stance on a topic that we should:


1. Get information from credible and ideally primary sources from subject matter experts
    - No ulterior motives
    - No conflict of interests or biases 

    <br>

2. Cross-reference with other credible sources


3. Almost everything is probabilistic. Form a hypothesis and find methods to disprove it.


If we want to share our views and opinions on certain sensitive matters, surely we will want to be make sure that the probability of making a fool of ourselves is minimised. Until then, we should not be too hasty to take a side. There is nothing inherently wrong with taking a side with little information, but we must weigh the cost and benefits, and we must be very prepared to be proven wrong. Hey, what do I know about all of this right?

Also check out my Ape Classifier <a href="https://github.com/gladwinyjh/harambAI">here</a>. It's a fun project that incorporates some visualization techniques that I have learnt for ConvNets in PyTorch. May or may not make a separate post on it.

Also last week, I found out that the LG brand (see below) stands for 'Lucky Goldstar' and not 'Life's Good'...
